# Sudoku Solver

This project implements a Sudoku solver in Python, demonstrating the use of backtracking algorithms to solve classic Sudoku puzzles. The solver efficiently finds solutions for a given Sudoku board, represented as a 2D list, where empty cells are denoted by zeros.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: The core solving mechanism uses backtracking to explore possible number placements, ensuring that the Sudoku rules are followed.
- **Validation Functionality**: Includes checks to validate the placement of numbers in rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Displays the original and solved Sudoku boards in a readable format, using dots to represent empty cells.

## Usage

To use the Sudoku solver, simply define a 9x9 board with numbers from 1 to 9 and zeros for empty cells. The solver will attempt to fill in the empty cells and print the solved board if a solution exists.

### Example

```python
# Example Sudoku board (0 represents empty cells)
board = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]

print("Original Sudoku board:")
print_board(board)

if solve_sudoku(board):
    print("\nSolved Sudoku board:")
    print_board(board)
else:
    print("No solution exists.")
```
